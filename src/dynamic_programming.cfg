  Provides dynamic programming interface, which allows users to write stackvm
  programs through the game console.

  Note: Programs written using this interface are usually a lot slower than the
  compiled version (using fasm). This is because of the fact that first you have
  to load the value of a label from the rpn database, and then use call_vfs. Using
  two instructions instead of one (compiled version).
